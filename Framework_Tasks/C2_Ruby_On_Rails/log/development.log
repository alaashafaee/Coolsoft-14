Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) create.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): create ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: create.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Contact with id(s) create.
Summary:
  When calling Contact.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): create ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: create.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:

Resolution:

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) search.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): search ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: search.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) search.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): search ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: search.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) search.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): search ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: search.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) sign_out.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): sign_out ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: sign_out.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Contact with id(s) 532c4a64e7537118ce000005.
Summary:
  When calling Contact.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 532c4a64e7537118ce000005 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 532c4a64e7537118ce000005.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):
